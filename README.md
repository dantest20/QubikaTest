# Qubika Automation Framework

## Description

This project is an automation framework for the Qubika sports club management system, utilizing Playwright and Python. The goal is to automate a complete workflow, including interactions with both the API and the user interface.

## Project Structure

- `builder/`: Contains builders for constructing data and objects needed for tests.
- `client/`: Contains API clients to interact with backend services.
- `config/`: Contains project configurations.
- `pages/`: Contains page files following the Page Object pattern.
- `tests/`: Contains test files.
- `pytest.ini`: Pytest configuration.

## Dependencies

The project dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file:
- Playwright
- Pytest
- Pytest-Playwright
- Requests

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository URL>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd qubika_automation
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional, but recommended).
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. Install the dependencies using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Run the tests using pytest.
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

## Future Improvements

To enhance the framework and align it more closely with business requirements, consider the following improvements:

- **Expand Test Coverage**: Continuously add new test cases to cover more features and edge cases. Ensure that all critical business workflows are thoroughly tested.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implement more comprehensive error and exception handling mechanisms to make the framework more resilient and reliable.
- **Test Reporting**: Integrate advanced reporting tools to generate detailed and customizable test reports. This will help stakeholders easily understand test results and identify areas for improvement.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate the automation framework with CI/CD pipelines to enable automated testing with each deployment. This ensures that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the framework for scalability to handle a larger number of tests and data sets efficiently. Consider parallel test execution and resource management.
- **Maintainability**: Refactor and modularize code to improve maintainability and readability. Implement coding standards and best practices to ensure consistency.
- **Performance Testing**: Incorporate performance and load testing to ensure the application can handle high traffic and usage scenarios.
- **Security Testing**: Add security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application.

By focusing on these areas, the framework can be designed and developed to better meet business requirements and provide more value to stakeholders.


## Comments
